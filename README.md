## Summary
The aim of the APSEV is to visualise a comparison of schools in Australia based on a number of metrics and to visualise these using Python and other tools within Jupyterlab. 

## Data

### Source

The data we will be using for this project is supplied by ACARA, the **Australian Curriculum, Assesment and Reporting Authority**.  

### School Profile Report

We will be utilising the School Profile report (2008-2019) offered by ACARA on their Data Access Program web page **here:** <https://www.acara.edu.au/contact-us/acara-data-access>

This is a vast collection of information from all schools in Australia between 2008-2019 and will provide a large amount of information for us to work with.

## Results

Even though we found some very interesting results from our data visualisation, the fact of the matter is that using a single score to judge how good a school performs is a terrible idea.  What a school offers to a child goes beyond learning outcomes such as extra curricular activities, travel time, public transport, friends attending the same school, primary focus of the school etc. 

At face value the decision would be "A Combined Catholic School located in Victoria", but that is not a definitive answer.  

The correct answer can be discoverd with time, for now I will enjoy the early formative years.
